# RoomSync: A Smart Boardmate Powered by AI

**A React Native mobile application for rental property listings in Dumaguete City and nearby municipalities.**

## Project Rationale

Finding safe, affordable, and convenient living spaces in Dumaguete City is challenging for students and employees relocating from other provinces or towns. Traditional word of mouth or basic listings on social media often lack updated information, honest reviews, or intelligent filtering.

RoomSync addresses this gap by providing a digital platform for apartment, room, and bed space listings tailored to user preferences. Features include location-based filtering, machine learning recommendations, and peer ratings to empower informed choices.

The project integrates data analytics to uncover trends in rental preferences and availability across Dumaguete City and nearby municipalities (Valencia, Sibulan, Bacong), with visualizations like heatmaps and charts for data-driven insights.

By combining essential functionalities, modern design, AI features, and APIs (Recommendation Systems, Google Maps), RoomSync offers a user-centered solution to real-world housing problems.
